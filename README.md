# AI-Based-Pneumonia-Detection-System-Using-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This project presents an AI-based clinical decision support system for detecting Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Deep Learning. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically analyze radiographic images and classify them as Pneumonia or Normal.
